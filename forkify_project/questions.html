    <h1>Questions to Know</h1>
    <p>
        What are primitive types , boolean, number, string, undefined, null
        javascript operator is similar to a function
        A constructor is a function that initializes an object. -method to create and initialize and object created 
        within a class. 
        1 == true // true - cause of type coersion 
        1 === true // false
        True && False = False
        A = true; B = false; 
        !(A||!B) && (A && !B && A) || (A || B)  = True
        "2" + 3 returns "23" cause of coersion of 3 to a string and strings added.
        function attached to a an object - -method
        browser, global execution context is - window 
        can you call funciton expression a at line 126 if a is declared in line 253? 
        -no only function declarations cna do this cause of hoisting.
        Thanks to Hoisting, Variables are set to undefined in the creation phase.
        anonymous functions - create a new scope, usually not accessible after initial creation,
        usually declared without any named identifier referring to them,  usually formed with closures
        remember scope chain Function A() {let x = 1 function B() {console.log(x)}} // 1
        Scopes are created by Functions - true
        the "this" keyword - created for each execution context, in method call, the 'this' keyword points to the obect its attached to
        in a method call the 'this' keyword is only defined as soon as the method gets called.
        DOM events are processed when execution stack is empty
        Event Delegation - use it when we need event handlers on unknonwn number of elements that are all children
        of a known element, makes use of event bubbling because event bubbling allow us to 'wait' until an event bubbles up to aknown element,
        use it when we need event handlers that are not in the DOM when our code enters the execution phase.
        Need event Object because it carries the key code property
        suppose create 2 new objects using a function constructor , how can we allow both objects to have access to a new method we creaet?
        - add the method to the protoype property of the funciton constructor. this is prototypal inheritance. 
        _____**** Composition > Inheritance. _______
        Composition - design types by what they do 
        Inheritance is when you design the type by what they are. (creates Gorilla with a banana problem)
        new operator will create new empty object, calls a function, and makes the 'this' variable of teh called function
        point to the newly created object. BUT IT Does not return an execution context
        functions is an object in js cause its prototype is an object, and so it inherits methods from the prototype
        Object A = Object B,  Mutating property X on A ,  X on B will be mutated cause A and B point to the same object.  
        array has acces to map method cause prototype chain
        map returns a new array,  
        forEach does not return new array.
        cause of closures - function A can declare variable x and returns function b and function 
        b can access variable x still.
        callback function is function passed to another function as an argument. 
        immediately invoked function expression is only called once.
        call method is useful for method borrowing cause it allows us to set the this variable manually
        Function.bind() -- creates a new function with preset arguments ! 
        encapsulation code cannot be overwrite private function and variables, exposed public interface is api
        exposed function can be accessed from the outer scope,  
        in module pattern, why can public methods access private functions and variables? - because closure was created.
