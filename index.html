            lightweight, cross platofrom object oriented programming language.  It takes up little memory, can be used on muliple
            platforms and systems, not just web, and uses objects. 
            one of 3 core techs for web dev
            traditionally only client side
            now is server side. 
            made modern web development possible.  
            dynamic effects and interactivity
            modern web applications that we can interact with. 

        </p>
        <p>
            works with html, css, js
            html content, css presentation, js for dynamic effects, etc. 
            html is noun,   css is adjective, and js is the verb.

            1996 changed from livescript to JavaScript to attract java developers
            but JS is almost nothing like java. 
            1997 - ECMAScript 1 (es1) first version of javascript   language standard:
                ECMA language standard

            <h1>JS behind scenes</h1>
            js is always hosted in an environment.  
            in browser,  or  or nodejs web server
            A js engine is a program that executes js code. 
            There are several like Chromes v8 engine 
            spidermonkey ,  javascript core
            1. Engine has a parser that knows the js rules and parses out the code. if there's an error 
            the engine will throw an error. 
            2. If code good, parser creates data structure called abstract syntax tree which is translated into machine 
            the machine code is code that the computers processor can run 
            3. this is when the code runs. 
            <h2>execution context and stack </h2>
            All js code needs to run in an environment and this is called Execution context.  
                (it is a box container wrapper which stores variables and in which a peice of our code is evaluaated and exectuted)

                Now, the default execution context
                is always the global context.
                Remember that I said that an execution context
                is where a piece of code is executed.
                Well, in a global context, all the code
                that is not inside of any function is executed,
                and this is very important.
            It is associated with global object , in browser its window object
            lastName = window.lastName // true 

        </p>

        <h1>Section 2: JavaScript Language Basics</h1>
        argument object is created containing all arguemtns passed into fÂ¨nction
code is scanned for function declarations , for each function a property is created in 
variable object pointing to the function - all functions in Variable Object before codes run
code is scanned for variable declarations
This means functions and variables are HOISTED - lifted up and available b4 execution phase

functions defined right away, 
variables are undefined until execution phase. 
EXECUTION PHASE JUST AFTER CREATION PHASE.
