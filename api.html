    <h1>API Time o boyeeeee</h1>
    <p>Application programming interface -
        Basically it's a way to get access to a bunch of data and maybe even tools to build something
        when you sign up for the API - you get an API key 
        API Key is a unique ID that you can use to make requests to the server of the api maker
        and they keep track of these requests with that api key.
