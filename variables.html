            Variables are little storage containers that hold values.
            var does not keep scope
            let can be written over 
            const cannot change
        </p>
        <h3>Data types</h3>
        <h4>Primitives</h4>
        <p>
            Javascript has dynamic typing - meaning data types are automatically assigned to variables so you don't 
            have to manually assign the type. 
            number - floating point for decimals and integers , so even if you see 5  it is 5.0
            string - sequence of characters used for text
            Boolean logical true or false
            Undefined - data type of a variable that does not have a value yet.
            Null - also means non-existent 
        Rules of assignment
        Cant start variablename with a number or symbols except $ or _ (underscore) 
        can't use reserved key words like var, delete, let, etc

            let age = 28; 
            let job;   // undefined 
            job = 'Teacher'; // now it is assigned. 
        // variable mutation and type coercion 
        var firstName = 'John';
        var age = 38; 
        console.log(firstName + ' ' + age); // this prints out a string,  turns the age a number into a string
        var job, isMarried; // declare many variables on one line and assign later.
        job = 'teacher';
        isMarried = false; // even boolean get type coerced into string
        // Variable mutation -change value of the variable
        age = 'twenty eight';
        job = 'programmer';
        // you can use aler('hello') 
        // prompt('what is his last name?')  this prompst user to post  and we get that value
