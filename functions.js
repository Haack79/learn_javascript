// create phase - creation of variable object (vo), scope chain, determine this variable
// 2. execution phase - code of the that generated exectuion context ran line by line
/*
argument object is created containing all arguemtns passed into fÂ¨nction
code is scanned for function declarations , for each function a property is created in 
variable object pointing to the function - all functions in Variable Object before codes run
code is scanned for variable declarations
This means functions and variables are HOISTED - lifted up and available b4 execution phase

functions defined right away, 
variables are undefined until execution phase. 
EXECUTION PHASE JUST AFTER CREATION PHASE.
