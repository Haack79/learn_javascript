    <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
    <p>remember synchronous is it doing it in one clean sweet, in order line by line. </p>
    <p>async below ,  first() gets called, runs, does the console.log hey there
        then calls second function , which calls setTimeout(webapi) that waits for the set setTimeout
        it goes on and logs console.log 'the end'; 
        after 2 seconds have passed it will log async in second func hey there; 

        the importance of this is to defer actions to the future to make sure it is non blocking
        we don't want code to get frozen doing a big load function. 
    </p>
    <p> execution stack -> WEbAPIS where settimeout(callbackfunction will wait - > message que and Event Loop
        execution stack will execute one after the other, while a callback function or setTimeout
    </p>
    <script>
        const second = () => {
            setTimeout(()=> {console.log('async in second func hey there')}, 2000); //waits 2 seconds // so prints last
        }
        const first = () => {
            console.log('hey there!');// prints first
            second();
            console.log('the end'); // prints second
        }
        first(); 
        const image = document.getElementById('img').src;
        processLargeImage(image, () => {
            console.log('image processed');
        });
