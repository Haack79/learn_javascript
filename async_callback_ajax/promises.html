    <h1>Promises</h1>
        <p>
            Promise is an object that keeps track of whether a certain event has happened or not
            if the event did happen then Promise determins what to do next. (a async event like timer or ajax call return)
            like hey get me data from the back ground 
        </p>
        <p>
            Has different states
            Pending is before event has happened
            After the event has happened the promise is called, settled / resolved. 
            When promise is available then it's fulfilled but if there was an error then promise
            was rejected. 
            Promise will either be fulfilled or rejected
            2 things. consume or produce
            produce is to create a new promise and sen a result using that promise
            then when we consume it we can use call back functions to fulfill 
        </p>
    <script>
        // first function is callback and called executor function and takes 2 arguments.
        const getIDs = new Promise(() => {

        })
