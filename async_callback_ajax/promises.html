    <h1>Promises</h1>
        <p>
            Promise is an object that keeps track of whether a certain event has happened or not
            if the event did happen then Promise determins what to do next. (a async event like timer or ajax call return)
            like hey get me data from the back ground 
        </p>
        <p>
            Has different states
            Pending is before event has happened
            After the event has happened the promise is called, settled / resolved. 
            When promise is available then it's fulfilled but if there was an error then promise
            was rejected. 
            Promise will either be fulfilled or rejected
            2 things. consume or produce
            produce is to create a new promise and sen a result using that promise
            then when we consume it we can use call back functions to fulfill 
        </p>

        // first function is callback and called executor function and takes 2 arguments.
        // the 2 arguments are the callbacks resolve and reject since the executor is what informs 
        // the Promise if it was successfull or not. 
        // If successfull call resolve funciton, if not call reject function. 
        const getIDs = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { 
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve([523, 883, 432, 974]);   // if do reject it will go to teh error. 
            }, 1500);
        });
        const getRecipe = recID => { // 1. into this getRecipe function we pass in recID, we then pass this into the setTimeout as 3rd argument below in number 2
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(ID => { //3. this is passed in as recID in number 2. 
                    const recipe = {title: 'fresh pasta', publisher: 'henry'};
                    resolve(`${ID}: ${recipe.title}`); // 4. then passed in here in callback function
                }, 1500, recID); // 2. this recID is passed in from getRecipe above. this is then declared as ID in set time out. 
            });
        };
        const getRelated = publisher => {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

                    resolve(`${pub}: ${recipe.title}`); 
                }, 1500, publisher);
            });
        };
        // if resolved meaning fulfilled// promise always can be handled with a .then method.  
        getIDs
        .then(IDs => {  //IDs is the call back function that the resolve gets put into // this is the fullfilled promise. 
            console.log(IDs); // this is the array that got resolved [523, 883, 432, 974]; 
            return getRecipe(IDs[2]); // A. this returns a promise that we return and handled in B below
        })// B. this 'then' function handles the result of promise from A. above
        .then(recipe => { // this recipe is what got resolved from 1 getRecipe above. 
            console.log(recipe); 
            return getRelated('Henry'); // this returns new Promise
        }) 
        .then(recipe => {
            console.log(recipe); 
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
