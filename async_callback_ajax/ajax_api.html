    <h1>Ajax API </h1>
<h2>ajax</h2>
<p>ajax is asynchronous javascript and xml and allows you to communicate with remote servers asynchronously 
    the browser/ client is running trying to get some data from servers.
    want to get the data without having to reload the whole page, 
    with ajax can do a get request that gets data asynchronous 
    can send data with a post
</p>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>Application Programming Interface piece of software that can be used by another piece of software
    to allow apps to talk to each other. 
    api is part of the server, application part that recieves requests and sends back responses
    There are 3rd party api's that you can use to get information from other servers such 
    as a weather api, google map api, embed youtube,  or send emails / text from venmo
</p>
<p> there are a few ways to make ajax calls but we will use fetch and promises
    will use web API called FETCH - available in the browser but not a part of javascript
    can use it to fetch asynchronously data across the internet  to fetch data from servers or our own
    This used to be done using the complex javascript XML HttpRequest
</p>
<p><em>cross or same origing policy which prevents from making ajax requests to different domain than your own</em>
    to allow making request to different domins us Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS);
    For this to work, the ones that made the api have to implement CORS on their server.
    if unable, way to get around
    proxy or channel the request through their own server. do ajax request on own server.
    cause it's yours, not going to see same origin policy issue

    if you dont want to use your server, a service does it,  crossorigin.me  

    FETCH gets data and returns a Promise and it has data or an error 

</p>
    <script>
        // make AJAX calls ith fetch and promises 
        // fetch(apiurl)  // metaweather.com api doesn't need a key // 
        // weather returns json, an entire string 
        // below use crossorigin.me
        function getWeather(location) {
            fetch(`https://crossorigin.me/https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=${location}`)
            .then(result => {
                console.log(result); // entire response
                return result.json(); // returns async this data
            })
            .then(data => {
                //console.log(data); // now has the data we want. 
                const today = data.consolidated_weather[0];
                console.log(`temperatures in ${data.title} is between ${today.min_temp} and ${today.max_temp}`);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.log(error); 
            });
        }
        getWeather('london'); 
        // -----------
        async await function getWeatherAW(location) {
        try {
            const result = fetch(`https://crossorigin.me/https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=${location}`);
            const data = await result.json();
            console.log(data); 
            const tomorrow = data.consolidated_weather[1];
            console.log(`temp for tomorrow ${data.title} will be between ${tomorrow.min_temp} and ${tomorrow.max_temp}`);
            return data;  // this returns result value of the Promise
            } catch(e) {
                console.log(e); 
                alert(e); 
            }
        }
        let londonData; 
        // remember this .then gives us access to the data returned from the Promise above. that way you can use it.
        // it will wait and then show the data. 
        getWeatherAW('london').then(data => {londonData = data; console.log(londonData)});
